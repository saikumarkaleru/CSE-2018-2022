JVM:
    Java virtual Machine(JVM) is a virtual Machine that provides runtime environment
    to execute java byte code. The JVM doesn't understand Java typo, that's why you 
    compile your *.java files to obtain *.class files that contain the bytecodes 
    understandable by the JVM.

    JVM control execution of every Java program. It enables features such as automated exception
    handling, Garbage-collected heap.



JRE : 
    The Java Runtime Environment (JRE) provides the libraries, the Java Virtual Machine, 
    and other components to run applets and applications written in the Java programming language. 
    JRE does not contain tools and utilities such as compilers or debuggers for developing applets
     and applications

JRE =  JVM + libraries [ NO compilers and debuggers]




JDK : 
    The JDK also called Java Development Kit is a superset of the JRE,
    and contains everything that is in the JRE, plus tools 
    such as the compilers and debuggers necessary for developing applets and applications.

JDK = JRE + compilers + debuggers
