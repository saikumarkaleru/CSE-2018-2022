Static Block in Java

    A static block in a program is a set of statements which are executed by the JVM 
    (Java Virtual Machine) before the main method. At the time of class loading, 
    if we want to perform any task we can define that task inside the static block, 
    this task will be executed at the time of class loading. In a class, any number of a
    static block can be defined, and this static blocks will be executed from top to bottom
